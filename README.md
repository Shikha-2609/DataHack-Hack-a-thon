I preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. I split the training data into training and validation sets, and train a Logistic Regression model wrapped in a MultiOutputClassifier with increased iterations to predict probabilities for both vaccine targets. The model is evaluated using ROC AUC scores, and predictions are made on the test set. Finally, I format the predictions as required and save them for submission.
